Community Fund
CSC309 Team Project: Phase 2

1.	Feature and Functionality Specification
  Community Fund will be a crowd funding website that brings communities and their residents together. It aims to do this by putting power and opportunity for improvement into the hands of those that know the neighborhood best and can provide the most positive change – the residents themselves. Further, Community Fund aims to align those with similar interests worldwide to support projects for which they feel passionately about.

1.1 Registration
  Anyone with internet access has the ability to register for the site. This means that anybody can begin helping a cause of their choice within minutes. Upon registration, new users are asked for information to be used for authentication, as well as their location and interests. This places them automatically into the communities corresponding to their interests (one community per interest) and their location (one community for the location).  

1.2 Communities and Profiles (Social Networks)
  Registration information inputted by the user initially is used to create a profile for every new user. As he or she continues to be active on Community Fund, their profile will gain new additions – reputation score, projects that have been funded or initiated by the user, or communities that they now belong to.

  Every community has a page which serves as a social network for the members of the community. Through this page, the user can stay up to date on both current and older projects occurring within the community. For every project started, a post is made on the community’s social network, on which users can comment, share, or be linked to the project’s page to donate. Users can also communicate with one another, whether it is to give an idea for a project, help brainstorm for one, or thank someone for something. All members of the community are automatically considered friends.

1.3 Projects
  When a project is created, its information gets displayed onto a project page. Every project has its own page, which features a description of it, a timeline for keeping track of milestones, links to rate or donate to the project and a meter showing the amount remaining to reach the financial goal. This is how users that are looking to fund projects can be exposed to them - data gets fed into social networks for the communities that this project belongs to. This helps keep users informed and targets those who may be the most willing to donate.

  Any registered user has the ability to search for or view projects that they feel passionately about and want to donate to. Users view projects on the community page through a toggle showing either the most recently created projects, or the top ones based on a priority system that incorporates initiator rating, project rating, and amount remaining to reach the goal. This will help projects that are in the most need for funding, or which are from the most trusted initiators. This system will encourage a better matching between those that need funding and those that are willing to give it.

1.4 User Roles
  Every user is given the power to choose how to use their account and time on the website. A user can choose to view available projects to fund, and contribute towards them. A user can also opt to initiate a project for others to fund.

  Upon funding, the user will be told how close the project is to its goal, and how they have contributed to that goal. The user will also be notified about the completion of projects that he or she has funded. The user also has the ability to choose between donating money and paying for a product in return, to be shipped after completion of the project. Both methods of payment will contribute to the financial goal of the project.

  To initiate a project, users create a new project page and are asked to input information that will help share it to the public. This information includes a description of the project, the financial goal required to complete it, the communities it is a part of, and prices required to buy the item if that’s how the user wishes to contribute. The information is then placed on the project page to be seen by users, who link to these pages through the communities they are associated with. 

1.5 Reputation
  Upon interaction, users can rate one another based on their dealings with each other. Interaction includes funding or communication. Reputation is given in the form of a 1 – 5 star rating. Reputation will assist users in deciding which projects they want to donate most to. Every user’s rating will be placed on their profile page, and that information will also be on the project pages for projects that they have initiated. When projects are completed, users are notified and encouraged to try out the finished product and leave another review.

1.6 Potential User Scenario: Joe
  Joe visits the new Community Fund website after hearing about a skating rink that is being funded in his community. He is passionate about hockey and loves to play it. Joe creates an account specifying his location and interests, and then visits the social network page for his community. He sees the skating rink project as a post on the recent tab of the social network page, reads some positive comments on the idea, and in doing so feels even more willing to contribute to the cause. Joe clicks the post and is directed to the project page for skating rink, where he sees more detailed specification regarding the project and its progress. He chooses to contribute through donation, $50. He is notified that he has helped the project reach its goal by an additional 3%, and exactly how much is remaining before completion. 

  Joe then decides to revisit his community’s page and sort available projects by “top”. He doesn’t see another he wishes to contribute to – at least not today – but gets a better idea of what kind of projects are initiated on the site, and even has some potential ideas of his own. Over the coming days and weeks Joe checks back to see progress on the skating rink, and he also enjoys viewing the newest projects to be added.

3. Software Architecture and High-level Design
3.1 High-level system architecture and interaction with environment

  We are planning to have three entities. (But it is possible to run to problems later on and improvements may needed to the database structure). 
  The first entity would be admin of the server. They are the administrator of the server, which in this case is going to be people in our group. 
  The second entity is our users of the server. They are the people who are going to be using our webpage services whether is a funder or an Initiator, they will both be considered as a User. We do not want to separate the two types of users at the beginning of account registration, We want to avoid constrictions on users to only have an account that can fund, then they suddenly want to make a startup company, they have to make an Initiator account, or vice versa. A User can fund and also initiate a company on the same account, this gives the user more flexibility and create less hassle.
  The third entity would be on the group/startup company side. These are startup companies initiated and need to be funded to continue their product/services. 

The relationships between each entities are:
•	User registers from administrator server. 
•	Company registers from administrator server.
•	User can join a company.
•	User can also fund a company by purchasing their goods and services or just purely donation.
•	A user can register a new startup company.

4.2 The schema:
	Administrator(aID, firstName, lastName, e-mail, Phone, Address)
	U-register(uID, uName, uDate)
	C-register(cID, cName, cDate)
	User(uID, firstName, lastName, reputation, Phone, e-mail, Address)
	Company(cID, cType, mName, memType, cReputation)
	Fund(uID, cID, Donation, payment, product, pMethod)
	Join(uID, cID, jDate)
	initiate(uID, cID, iDate)
	
Join(uID) ⊆ User(uID)
Fund(uID) ⊆ User(uID)
Initiate(uID) ⊆ User(uID)
Join(cID) ⊆ Company(cID)
Fund(cID) ⊆ Company(cID)
Initiate(cID) ⊆ Company(cID)
Company(mName) ⊆ User(uID)

•	The table Administrator will store the admin’s aID, their first name and last name and their contact information.
•	The table U-register contains the user id who registered, the name of the user and the date they registered.
•	The table C-register contains the company/project ID, the name of the company and the registration date of the company/project.
•	The table User contains the User ID their first name and last name reputation, and personal/business contact information.
•	The table Company contains the company ID, the company type, members and their project/company reputation.
•	The table Fund contains the user ID of the funder, the ID of the company, the amount of donation, the product/payment they made if funder is purchasing a product and the payment method they’ve used for that transaction, and the date of the transaction.
•	The table Join enable User to join a company that they are interested in, contains uID of the joined user and the cID of the company (the invitation sent from).
•	The table Initiate allows user to initiate on a new project/company, it contains the user ID who initiates a project, cID for registration purposes and the date the project was initiated on.

5. Test Strategy and Test Plan
 Generally, testing is completed during production since the cost of fixing a defect in an integrated system could be extremely high.  Testing strategies and responsibilities of 4 main areas are described below.

5.1	Code Quality (Lucas, Drew)
  For smaller websites with limited budgets, it is important to design with web standards, because it ensures the website’s compatibility and minimize the cost on the future maintenance.  
•	We will use W3C validator to check (X)HTML documents and Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) files. And we will check whether all styles that appear in the (X)HTML are from CSS to ensure the separation between content and presentation.
•	All the links will be tested regularly using W3C link Checker.

5.2 Accessibility (Lucas)
•	Using a screen reader to ensure that all links and “alt” attributes are descriptive for blind users.
•	Test the web site on major browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera, etc.
•	Using Google Chrome Developer Tools to simulate the web site on other devices including phones, tablets and so on.

5.3 Functionality (JavaScript: Lucas, Drew; Node.js: Danny, Ou; Other: all)
  Since in our project most functions will be implemented using JavaScript and Node.js, so here we mainly discuss how to test code written in these two languages. And the main strategy will be used is unit/integration testing.
  A unit test is a test on a relatively small piece of code, usually a function or a method of a class. The process includes extracting the code, creating a dummy inputs, and verifying the outputs.  
  After applying unit tests on the critical parts, they will be assembled together and perform integration testing on them as a whole. 
•	For JavaScript code, we will first use JSHint to briefly detect errors and potential problems. And perform unit/integration testing using KARMA.
•	For Node.js code, the unit test will be performed using Mocha and Supertest library will help perform integration tests involved with servers.

5.4 Performance (Ou, Danny)
•	We will use the Heroku cloud application platform to load/stress test the website with an add-on called Blitz.
