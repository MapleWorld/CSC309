Due: Thurs. Feb. 12, 2015
Group: Lucas Pan, Drew Zhao, Ou Ye, Daniel Velev
•	In this first week we began doing introductory work on the individual parts of Phase III.
•	This included doing research on the web, looking to see what comparable funding platforms currently exist and what methods exist for performing the tasks we needed to accomplish.
•	Research was done on large, general crowdfunding sites such as Kickstarter, Indiegogo, and Crowdfunder, but time was also spent viewing more niche sites we had heard of, such as appbackr.
•	Lucas focused on the UI elements and how our initial design compares to the front end for some of these popular funding platforms.
•	Drew and Danny took notes on potential database design tips, and in general focused on these websites’ implantation of databases.
•	Ou researched the back end of these sites, garnering information on how they completed the majority of the back end tasks.
•	We were interested in how these similar websites performed the task of crowd funding, and found the information valuable. We did recognize that our site is altogether different in many cases, and so comparing and contrasting to these other sites furthered and solidified our thoughts and our ideas on our own project, Community Fund. 
•	We all began to consider how to implement the ideas and design we laid out in Phase II, but for now, more in terms of our own assigned elements.
•	In the coming week, we will further this process mentioned above, and continue to look more into advancing the coded aspects of our project.
•	We hope to meet as a group as well to consider how to gather our individual parts to bring the whole phase together in time for the due date.
